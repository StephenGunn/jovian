# JovianMoon.io - My Personal Site and Blog

This project powers [JovianMoon.io](https://jovianmoon.io), my personal site and blog. Feel free to browse the
site and contact me if you have any questions.

## Creating a Project

If you're reading this, you've probably already set up the project. But just in case, here’s how you can
create a new Svelte project:

```bash
# Create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# Or, create a new project in a directory named my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you
can start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# Or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> **Note:** To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for
> your target environment.

## Important Notes

This project might require certain `.env` variables to run properly. However, I won’t be covering those in
this README. Please be aware that you’re using this project at your own risk.
