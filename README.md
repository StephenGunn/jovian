# JovianMoon.io - Personal Site and Blog

This project powers [JovianMoon.io](https://jovianmoon.io), my personal site and blog.

It's built with SvelteKit and was developed during the beta phases of Svelte 5 as an
exercise to learn the new framework.

## Running Locally

If you clone this project you can attempt to run it locally. This may or may not work
depending on the state of site and if I am using any private APIs or services.

```bash
npm run dev

# Or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Important Notes

This project might require certain `.env` variables to run properly. However, I won’t be
