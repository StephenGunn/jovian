## Gibraltar 1970

This was a special project for my neighbors during the 2020 pandemic. They were
celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary and had to cancel their party. I created this
interactive story for them to share with their friends and family.

If you want to check out the project, you can visit the
[Gibraltar 1970](https://gibraltar1970.com) website and use the password "edgerton1"

The story is about their wedding in Gibraltar in 1970.
