## CraftRoulette.live

Craft Roulette is a weekly art challenge that features contributors from all around the
world. The website is built with SvelteKit and uses Directus as the backend.

This is honestly a huge project that I've been working on for a while. It has ~10
applications in a monorepo.

I plan on writing more about what has gone into building this project in the future. But
please check out the website and let me know what you think!
