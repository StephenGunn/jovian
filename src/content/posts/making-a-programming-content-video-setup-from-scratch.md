## I work with media

Yada yada, I work with media.

I am currently building a live platform for yada yada.

Because of this, I have been building out equipment for live streaming art.

I am honestly more interested in creating the environment than I am actual content, but
I'll see what I can do

## What makes a good video environment?

what are you trying to accomplish? are you trying to teach a class? are you trying to be a
twitch streamer?

differences between making something for a game, art, vs learning and teachin=

- entertaining
- easy to view

## My goal for this project

- balance between asthetics and clear code presentation
- use the customizibility of my system to come up with a nice presentation mode that i can
  toggle with a simple command

## In search of inspiration

- joy of code
- awesome
- dev ops toolbox
- the guy who does the vids in the coffee shops
