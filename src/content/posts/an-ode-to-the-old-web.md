## "The modern web is a mess"

A sentiment that reverberates around reddit and micro-blogs like a shout bouncing around a
canyon. Don't get me wrong, I agree with it; both as a user and a builder. Beit websites
covered in ads or hallucinated AI driven search results, we're living in a black mirror
episode come to life.

But this is all well trodden ground that doesn't need to be rehashed. I want to remember
the old web.

## How I started building

I've always liked to build. If I like something, I'll try to make my own version of it. My
dad took me bowling for the first time when I was 3. I built my own 'bowling ally' when I
got home using the random items and toys that a 3 year old could get his hands on.

The first computer I had access to that connected to anything like the modern internet was
a 486 with Compuserve. I don't think I was even allowed to use it, but it piqued my
interest.

My family upgraded to AOL and a 14.4 modem, which I was allowed to use. I didn't absorb
much information, but the idea that I could connect to other peoples computers over a
phone line was cool.

When I got a little older, and my family moved from AOL to a regular dialup ISP, I bought
a book on HTML 4. I don't remember the exact motivation, other than I wanted to make
something on the computer, and the internet seemed cool.

I got one of my parents to take me to Barns and Nobel, and I bought "The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Creating An HTML 4 Web Page" (published December 15, 1997). I remember learning
about how to use Notepad on Windows 95 to create an HTML document.

I remember learning about `<html>`, `<font>`, `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<b>`, `<img>`,
and even `<marquee>` tags. I remember learning about the difference in web browsers, and
how Netscape is what real web developers use. I remember learning that `<marquee>` didn't
work in Netscape 3.0... wtf?
